    I have a variety of interests ranging from crafts to amusement parks to perusing farm fresh produce at giant supermarkets.  I also like to just relax and stroll around outdoor gardens or get some quality time at the spa.  Doesn't hurt to get some shopping in either so I would count that in as a fun pasttime for yours truly.  Here a quick hit list of some great places to check out if you want to share in some of my fun.
