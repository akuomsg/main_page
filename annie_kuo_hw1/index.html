	<h3 style="color:#2ECC71"><u>About Me + My <em>CLAY</em>tivity</u></h3>
	<p> Hello this is Annie.  One of my best memories as a child was the summer I discovered ceramics.</p>
	<p> I really enjoyed being able to exercise my creativity through clay as a medium.  It was great fun to see a lump of earth take shape right before my eyes!</p> 
	<p>(Engaging in this web development course reminds me of that experience.)</p>
	<p>I recently took a handbuilding workshop in NYC which allowed me to re-connect with my childhood past time.</p>
	<p>You don't have to star in the movie <i>Ghost</i> to create a beautiful ceramic piece.  You can start by crafting a PINCH POT - an easy clay pot or bowl created simply by pinching and pressing a ball of clay into the desired shape.</p>
