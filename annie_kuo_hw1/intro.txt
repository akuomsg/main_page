Introduction

My name is Annie Kuo and I am currently in a Staffing/Project manager capacity within an Advanced Technology consulting group.  I am the only non-techie amongst a team of front end, back end, and full stack developers.

I look forward to gaining a greater understanding of coding fundamentals as it pertains to web and front end development.

I would like this course to help me gauge my ability to grasp the concepts, apply them, and get into the mindset of “how a developer would think” to solve a problem.

I do not come from a computer science nor technology background so this will be a true challenge for me as I am going into this head first.  I am a little apprehensive but am always up for a new adventure and will give it my best.
